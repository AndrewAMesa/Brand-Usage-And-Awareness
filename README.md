# Brand-Usage-And-Awareness
This Python code was created and utilized in a project titled " Improving Brand Recognition and Association for Poetry Organizations". This code was used to analyze survey responses about brand awareness and usage on the parent brand and subsidiaries of the project's sponsor, Haus für Poesie which is a poetry house in Berlin, Germany. The pandas' library, correlation matrices, and bar charts were utilized in this analysis.

# Instructions to Run Code

1. **Download Python**, which can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Ensure pip is installed** (it is bundled with recent Python versions).
3. **Install necessary libraries** using pip (e.g., Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, etc.).
4. **Copy the files** from this repository to your local machine.  
   - **Note:** The CSV files only contain a few entries, randomly generated to protect the confidentiality of respondents.
5. **Run `analysis.py`.**  
   - Created graphs will be saved in the same folder as the code on your device.  
   - Graphs can also be viewed by uncommenting `plt.show()`, but issues with displaying them may occur.
